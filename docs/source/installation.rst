Currently, this library is only available via GitHub and isn't yet packaged as a binary,
so you'll need to clone the git repository.

To clone the git repository using HTTPS, run:

>>> git clone https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Pipeline-Logic.git

or to clone using SSH, run:

>>> git clone git@github.com:Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Pipeline-Logic.git

To change directory into the cloned repository and install dependencies, run:

>>> cd OIF-Pipeline-Logic
>>> poetry install

The library should now be available locally.
