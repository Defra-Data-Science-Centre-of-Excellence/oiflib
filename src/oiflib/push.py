"""A function to upload processed data to the GitHub repo.

The OpenSDG platform requires data to be uploaded to the site's GitHub repo as a
CSV. Given a DataFrame and an indicator code, this function saves an appropriately
named CSV and then uploads it to GitHub.

Example:
    >>> publish(
        df=a1_formatted_validated,
        indicator_code="a1",
    )

To do this the :func:`publish` function does the following:

#. it resets the local git repository to match the remote repository.
#. it to convert the OIF alphanumeric code to an OpenSDG compatable three-part numeric
   code.
#. it write the processed DataFrame to the local repository.
#. it adds the file to the local repository's index.
#. it records the changes to the local repository.
#. it pushes those local changes to the remote repostory.

.. note::
    SDG uses a three part Goal-Target-Indicator (GTI) numeric code, so the name of the
    CSV file must follow the format `indicator_#-#-#.csv`, where each # is an integer
    identifying, respectively, the goal, target, and indicator.

    To make OIF fit the SDG convention, this function uses a look-up to convert the
    alphanumeric OIF codes into a three part Theme-Indicator-Chart (TIC) format. For
    example, OIF's A1 indicator would have a TIC code of 1-1-1, whereas, OIF's C1b
    indicator would have a TIC code of 3-1-2.
